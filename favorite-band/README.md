#My favorite-band is HEART


###Ann and Nancy Wilson changed the face of rock throughout the 70s. Amalgamating elements of early rock n’ roll, folk and hard rock, the Wilson sisters were a key pillar in developing what sonic directions were possible within rock music. Getting their footing in 1975, the band’s debut record Dreamboat Annie proved the group capable of writing chart topping hit singles like “Crazy On You,” which would be a stepping stone to the band’s seminal and multi-platinum record Little Queen in 1977.

###Acknowledging their stature and legacy in rock, Heart we’re inducted into the Rock n’ Roll Hall of Fame in 2013. The band is currently still active and they’ve only recently announced a massive North American tour for 2024.
